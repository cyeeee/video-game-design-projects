# Project 0 - Logo Animation

This is a warm-up programming exercise to draw something in p5js. In this project, you are asked to:

- Create a logo with animation using any two (or more) letters in your name (can be upper or lower case). If you wish, the letters can also form something else, such as a vehicle, a flower, a building, or anything else. Be creative!

- You need to draw your logo (including the two letters) using ellipse(), rect(), quad(), triangle(), point(), arc(), or any drawing function provided by p5. The key is to draw the various shapes for the logo that are used to create the letters (and any other objects) in you logo.

- Animate the logo any way you'd like, be creative!

- The documentation (as part of comments in your code) should describe the intent behind your design, what letters in your name, what they do, etc. Also, the documentation should include standard commenting practices for explaining the functions, variables, etc.
