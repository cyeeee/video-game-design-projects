In this project, you are to combine space invaders with pong.

- Starting screen with your Logo from Project 0 (but you may change that Logo if you wish)
- Make the invaders look better (draw a better invader than the one provided in the sample)
- The overall logic of space invaders can be the same as the one provided in Lecture 3.
- There should be a ball, like pong, similar to the example given in Lecture 2 + 3.
- The ball will start out in a random direction and bounces off the borders.
- If the ball is shot, spawn another ball.
- The gun must also act like a paddle to catch the ball. That is, if any ball touches the bottom border, game over.
- If a ball touches an invader, the ball bounces (but nothing happens to the invader). Note the direction of bounce depends on the position of the two objects in question. That is, sometimes it is the x-direction of the ball that will be inverted, other times it would be the y-direction.
- No collision between the balls. That is, a ball can pass through one another.
- When a bomb touches a ball, the bomb disappears. Nothing happens to the ball.
- When all the invaders are gone, you win.
- You should also have a separate  game over screen.
