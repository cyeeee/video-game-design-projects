# Project 11 - 3D

This project is on the modeling of 3D objects. In this project, you are asked to

- Draw a building that looks like the one shown below (it does not have to look exactly like it, just something similar).
- The building will be shown as a wire-frame or with faces colored by the clicking of the mouse on the canvas. That is, the mouse click toggles between these 2 modes.
- Dragging the mouse will rotate the view.
- When it is the face-colored mode, please color all the faces/surfaces. The windows can just be light-blue panes. You do not need to embed textures. Instead, each face can simply be a solid color. Note that not all faces may be visible at any given time. But please ensure the color on different faces vary a bit, so that you can distinguish them. For example, the color on the different walls should differ.
- DO NOT use P3D / WEBGL / web3D when creating the canvas in the setup function.
